# Satmap Candidate Test
This is the test for candidates for the current developer position at satmap systems. This test has 5 parts, made up of issues currently listed in our issues tab of this repo. 

Candidates should look to limit themselves to around two hours though this test may be designed to run longer and candidates can complete all tasks regardless of time if they so wish.  

These tests do not need to be performed in the order they've been assigned.

## Workflow
- Candidates should clone this repository to their own account. __DONT FORK!__ 
	(Ideally the new repo would be private but for those without a pro account this isn't required, just avoid linking to the repository in a public way as other candidates may discover you and your code.)
	
- @satmap should be added as a collaborator on this new repository.

- The issues listed within the issues tab of this repository should be fixed on the new repo each with its own issue branch.
	(You don't need to remake these issues in your repo unless you'd like to, simple reference ticket numbers in branch names)
	
- Pull requests should be created for each of the issue branches. These requests should explain the changes in your code.

- Once all issues have been resolved you should submit a link to your new repository by email to alan.cole@satmap.com for review.


__Please do not submit your code publically by pull request.__
